# HumbleBragDashboard
This is an automated dashboard powered by Streamlit and GitHub Actions that scrapes my Strava data daily. Why? Because I’m too lazy to update spreadsheets manually, but not too lazy to run a 10k. It visualizes years of sweat, tracks my leaderboard attempts and mathematically proves that I am, in fact trying my best.
